# Installation

## Download Ultimate Terrains

You can download Ultimate Terrains through the [Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/31100). Welcome to the community of uTerrains users! :)

If you are still hesitating, you can try the [online demo](https://uterrains.com/demo/), get a look at the [official Ultimate Terrains thread on Unity's forum](https://forum.unity.com/threads/uterrains-ultimate-terrains-voxel-terrain-engine.383959/) or ask for details on the [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/tzrBuyY).


## Installation instructions

Installing Ultimate Terrains is a very simple process.

### Install with Unity 5.6 or Unity 2017
Ultimate Terrains is fully compatible with Unity 5.6.x and Unity 2017.x, however it is **strongly recommended** to use Unity 2018 as **it will run approximately 2 times faster with it**.
So if you *can* update your Unity version, **do it**!

If you are obliged to keep an old version of Unity, follow these instructions:

- Just download and import Ultimate Terrains into your project like any other asset. All files are mandatory so please import everything.
- To complete the installation you may need to restart Unity in order to get the new menu under *Tools &gt; uTerrains*.

That's all! If you get any error at this point, try to re-import Ultimate Terrains in a blank project, so you can check if the problem comes from your project or not. In particular, if you are updating an existing project, you should remove the uTerrains folder before importing the new version (be careful to not lose your own scripts if you do so!). You shouldn't get any conflict with other assets, but if you do please [let us know](https://uterrains.com/report/).

### Install with Unity 2018 or more recent
Unity 2018 or more recent version is highly recommended to get the most out of Ultimate Terrains. Installation is still very simple, but you'll have to do a small configuration change in your project settings (recommended, not mandatory).

- **Before importing Ultimate Terrains into your project, set the *Scripting Runtime Version* to *.NET 4.x Equivalent* in *Player Settings.***
- Go to Player Settings (Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player) and select *.NET 4.x Equivalent* as Scripting Runtime Version.
- Once this is done, download and import Ultimate Terrains into your project like any other asset. All files are mandatory so please import everything.
- To complete the installation you may need to restart Unity in order to get the new menu under Tools &gt; uTerrains.

That's all! If you get any error at this point, try to re-import Ultimate Terrains in a blank project, so you can check if the problem comes from your project or not. In particular, if you are updating an existing project, you should remove the uTerrains folder before importing the new version (be careful to not lose your own scripts if you do so!).
