# Voxel Types Tab

The Voxel Types editor is found in the uTerrain inspector under the Voxel Types tab.

## Terrain Materials
Defines the materials available for use by different Voxel Types (see below). The *material index*, which is used by Voxel Types in the section below is listed to the left of the Material selection slot after the word "Material". For example, the index of the first material listed, "Material 0", is 0. Fairly straight-forward.

## Global Grass Settings
Grass settings global to the entire terrain are defined here.
**Grass casts shadows:** *bool* If checked, grass will cast shadows to be received by other geometry in the scene.
**Grass receives shadows:** *bool* If checked grass will receive shadows from other objects in the scene.

## Voxel Types
Ultimate Terrain's Voxel Types are defined with a fairly simple set of parameters:

![Voxel Type Parameters](/images/voxel-type-overview.png)

**Name:** This will be the reference name that you use in your terrain's biomes (we'll cover that next). **IMPORTANT: each Voxel Type must have a UNIQUE NAME!**

**Material Index:** The material to be used on the geometry generated around this voxel. The index corresponds to the index of the materials defined in the Terrain Materials section above.

**Priority:** In some cases, your terrain will need to choose between several candidates for a Voxel Type. In those cases, the one with highest Priority value will be chosen. **IMPORTANT: each Voxel Type must have a UNIQUE PRIORITY!**

**Blockiness:** Determines how cubical a voxel of this type will look. A Blockiness value of 0 will result in a blended voxel geometry and a Blockiness value of 1 will result in a completely cubical voxel geometry (think Minecraft). Values between 0 and 1 will interpolate between completely smooth and completely cubical. Play around with this setting later to get a feel for how it operates.

**VoxelTypeFunction:** A script that determines the color of vertices generated by voxels of this type. The default one simply returns the color specified in the 'Vertex Color' field below.

**Vertex Color:** When using the Default VoxelTypeFunction, vertices generated by voxels of this type will have this rgba value.

The last three sections of a voxel type deal with objects spawned on top of the terrain.
**Grass:** Enable/disable grass geometry for this Voxel Type.

**Details:** Once we defined some details we'll be able to choose which ones can spawn on this Voxel Type.

**Trees:** Once we define some Trees we can specify which types spawn on this Voxel Type.
